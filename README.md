# Genome-wide association for thermal performance curves in _Neurospora crassa_

This repository describes phenotypic and data and analysis scripts related to the manuscript: [Genome-wide association for loci influencing thermal performance curves in Neurospora crassa](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.29.591604v1)

Note that there is another repository for the nested association mapping population itself: [Neurospora_NAM_population](https://github.com/ikron/Neurospora_NAM_population) and the genotype file is available at [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11120317)

## Phenotypic data

The phenotypic data used in this manuscript is from  [Moghadam et al. 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/evo.14016) and consist of growth rate measurements of different strains of the filamentous fungus _Neurospora crassa_. This data is combined with SNP data for all of these strains to perform association mapping. The data is also available from [Dryad](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.pk0p2ngk9). However, the most recent version of the data is folder /data/
